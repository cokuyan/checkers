Checkers
------------

This is a game of checkers programmed in Ruby 2.1.2 during my time at App Academy. The game follows the standard rules of Checkers, except for the rule that requires one to make a capture if possible. At this time, there is no computer AI and the game starts with two human players.

### How to Play
+ Run the checkers.rb file
+ Load game if a saved game is present
+ Enter a piece's location via algebraic notation
+ Enter piece's target location via algebraic notation
+ If possible, enter any additional jump moves
+ To save, enter 'save' at the start of a player's turn
+ To quit, enter 'quit' at the start of a player's turn
